# EPDE

## Overview

The EPDE project provides a framework for discovering and modeling differential equations from data. It incorporates evolutionary algorithms and multi-objective optimization techniques to search for equation structures that best fit the observed data. The framework supports various data preprocessing methods, custom token definitions, and integration with numerical solvers.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of EPDE is to automate the process of identifying governing differential equations from experimental or observational data. This allows users to gain insights into the underlying dynamics of complex systems and build predictive models.
