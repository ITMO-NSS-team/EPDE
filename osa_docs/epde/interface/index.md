# Interface

## Overview

The `interface` module within the EPDE project serves as a crucial bridge between raw data, equation representations, and the evolutionary search algorithms that drive the equation discovery process. It provides tools for translating equations from text-based formats, defining custom tokens representing mathematical functions and data features, and managing the overall search strategy. This module encapsulates the core logic for parsing equations, preparing data, and configuring the evolutionary search, enabling users to effectively explore the space of possible equation structures.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `interface` module is to facilitate the automated discovery of differential equations from data by providing the necessary components for:

*   **Equation Translation:** Converting equations from human-readable text formats into a structured representation suitable for manipulation by the EPDE framework.
*   **Token Definition:** Defining custom tokens that represent mathematical functions, data features (e.g., polynomials, trigonometric functions), or control variables, allowing the user to tailor the search space to the specific problem.
*   **Search Configuration:** Setting up the evolutionary search strategy, including parameters for optimization algorithms, multi-objective optimization, and data preprocessing.
*   **Experiment Management:** Combining results from multiple experiments to identify the best solutions and providing tools for analyzing the equation discovery process.
*   **Multi-Sample Handling:** Extending the EPDE framework to handle multiple datasets, enabling equation discovery across different experimental conditions or scenarios.
