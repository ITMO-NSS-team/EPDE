# MOEADD

## Overview

The MOEADD module implements a Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) for solving multiobjective optimization problems. It provides tools for managing Pareto levels, constructing populations, defining solution templates, and implementing evolutionary strategies. The module includes functionalities for non-dominated sorting, constraint handling, and visualization of Pareto frontiers.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the MOEADD module is to provide an efficient and flexible framework for finding a set of Pareto-optimal solutions to multiobjective optimization problems. It decomposes the multiobjective problem into several single-objective subproblems, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach. This allows users to approximate the Pareto front, representing the trade-offs between different objectives. The module is designed to be customizable, allowing users to define their own solution representations, evolutionary operators, and constraint handling methods.
