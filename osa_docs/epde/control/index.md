# Control Module

## Overview

The Control module within the EPDE project focuses on providing tools for incorporating control strategies into the equation discovery and modeling process. It offers classes and functions for defining control constraints, implementing optimization algorithms, and conducting control experiments. This module enables the user to optimize system behavior by manipulating control parameters within the discovered differential equation models.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Control module is to facilitate the integration of control mechanisms into the EPDE framework. This allows users to not only discover the underlying differential equations governing a system but also to actively influence the system's behavior through optimized control inputs. The module provides functionalities for:

*   Defining and applying constraints on control parameters.
*   Implementing various optimization algorithms to find optimal control strategies.
*   Conducting control experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different control approaches.
*   Calculating finite-difference approximations of gradients for parameter optimization.
*   Preparing control input tensors from solutions of controlled equations.
