# Optimizers

## Overview

The `optimizers` module provides a set of optimization algorithms tailored for use within the EPDE framework. It includes base classes for defining custom optimizers and implementations of specific optimization techniques like NGD and PSO. The module is designed to facilitate the training and parameter tuning of equation discovery models.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `optimizers` module is to offer a flexible and extensible collection of optimization methods suitable for training models that identify differential equations from data. It allows users to select and customize optimization algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of equation discovery within the EPDE project.
