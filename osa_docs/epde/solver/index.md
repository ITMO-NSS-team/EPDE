# Solver

## Overview

The `solver` module within the EPDE project provides the core functionality for solving differential equations using various numerical and analytical methods. It encompasses data preprocessing, model definition, numerical derivative calculation, loss computation, and solution evaluation. The module is designed to be flexible, supporting different computational devices and offering tools for caching and accelerating the solution process.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `solver` module is to provide a high-level interface for solving differential equations within the EPDE framework. It handles the complexities of data preparation, model construction, and numerical computation, allowing users to focus on defining the problem and interpreting the results. The module supports various solution methods, including neural networks, finite differences, and analytical techniques, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
