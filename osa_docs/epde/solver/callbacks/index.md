# Callbacks

## Overview

The `callbacks` module within the EPDE project provides a set of tools for customizing and extending the training process of equation discovery models. It includes functionalities for adaptive lambda computation, caching preprocessed data and trained models, defining custom callbacks, managing lists of callbacks, implementing early stopping criteria, printing parameters during inverse task solutions, and plotting solutions.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `callbacks` module is to enhance the flexibility and efficiency of the equation discovery process. It allows users to:

- Adaptively adjust lambda parameters during training.
- Cache preprocessed data and trained models to accelerate subsequent training runs.
- Define custom actions to be performed at various stages of the training process.
- Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting and reduce training time.
- Monitor and visualize the progress of inverse task solutions.
- Plot solutions to gain insights into the discovered equations.
