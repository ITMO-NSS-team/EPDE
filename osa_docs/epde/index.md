# EPDE Module

## Overview

The EPDE module provides a comprehensive framework for discovering and modeling differential equations from data. It encompasses a wide range of functionalities, including data preprocessing, equation representation, evolutionary optimization, and numerical solution techniques. The module is designed to facilitate the automated identification of governing equations from experimental or observational data.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the EPDE module is to automate the process of discovering differential equations from data. This involves:

*   **Data Handling:** Providing tools for loading, caching, transforming, and normalizing data, including time series data.
*   **Equation Representation:** Defining data structures for representing equations, terms, and factors, and providing mechanisms for parsing and translating equations from text-based formats.
*   **Derivative Calculation:** Implementing various methods for calculating numerical derivatives, including finite differences, spectral methods, and automatic differentiation.
*   **Evolutionary Optimization:** Employing evolutionary algorithms and multi-objective optimization techniques to search for equation structures that best fit the observed data.
*   **Fitness Evaluation:** Defining fitness functions to evaluate the quality of candidate equations based on their ability to reproduce the observed data.
*   **Sparsity Application:** Simplifying equations by removing insignificant terms and applying sparsity constraints.
*   **Numerical Solution:** Providing tools for numerically solving differential equations using various methods, including spectral solvers, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and traditional numerical integration techniques.
*   **Control Integration:** Incorporating control strategies into the equation discovery and modeling process, allowing users to optimize system behavior through control parameters.
*   **Experiment Management:** Combining results from multiple experiments to identify the best solutions and providing tools for analyzing the equation discovery process.
*   **Model Training and Prediction:** Training artificial neural networks (ANNs) to approximate data and using them to predict values for given grids.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Smoothing data, pruning the domain, and interpolating/oversampling data to prepare it for equation discovery.
*   **Parametric Equation Optimization:** Representing and optimizing parametric equations by managing optimizable parameters within factors.
