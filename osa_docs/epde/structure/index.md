# Structure Module

## Overview

The Structure module forms the architectural backbone of the EPDE framework, defining the fundamental data structures and classes necessary for representing and manipulating equations, terms, and genes within the evolutionary process. It provides the building blocks for constructing and evolving equation-based models.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Structure module is to provide a robust and flexible framework for representing mathematical equations and their components. This includes defining classes for genes, chromosomes, terms, equations, and systems of equations, as well as iterators for traversing these structures. The module also includes utilities for checking metaparameters and ensuring the uniqueness of objects within a given context. These components are essential for the symbolic regression tasks performed by EPDE, enabling the discovery of governing differential equations from data.
