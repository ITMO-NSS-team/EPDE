# Parametric Equations

## Overview

This module provides tools for representing and optimizing parametric equations. It includes classes and functions for parsing equations, managing optimizable parameters within factors, and evaluating equations and their gradients. The module is designed to work with both parametric and defined factors, allowing for the construction and optimization of complex equation structures.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to facilitate the discovery of differential equations by enabling the optimization of equation parameters to fit observed data. It provides the necessary components for representing equations with optimizable terms, parsing parametric factors, and constructing factor objects. This allows users to define and optimize equation structures within the EPDE framework.
