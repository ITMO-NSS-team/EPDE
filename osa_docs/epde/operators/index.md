# Operators

## Overview

The `operators` module within the EPDE framework provides a suite of tools and techniques for discovering and optimizing differential equations from data. It encompasses functionalities for single-objective and multi-objective optimization, equation coefficient calculation, fitness evaluation, and sparsity application. The module is designed to facilitate the construction, evaluation, and simplification of candidate differential equations, enabling the identification of governing equations from data.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `operators` module is to supply the essential building blocks for constructing and refining candidate differential equations. It offers a range of optimization algorithms, fitness functions, selection methods, and utility functions to quantify how well an equation matches the observed data, select the most appropriate terms for the equation, and simplify equations by removing insignificant terms. This module automates the process of identifying governing differential equations from data by providing tools for parameter management, operator mapping, and handling compound operations.
