# Common

## Overview

The `common` module provides a set of tools and operators essential for the equation discovery process within the EPDE framework. It includes functionalities for calculating equation coefficients, evaluating fitness functions, selecting the right-hand side of equations, and applying sparsity techniques. This module is designed to work with data and equation objects, facilitating the search for the best-fitting equation structures.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `common` module is to provide the building blocks for constructing and evaluating candidate differential equations. It offers a range of fitness functions to quantify how well an equation matches the observed data, methods for selecting the most appropriate terms for the equation, and techniques for simplifying equations by identifying and removing insignificant terms. These components are crucial for automating the process of identifying governing differential equations from data.
