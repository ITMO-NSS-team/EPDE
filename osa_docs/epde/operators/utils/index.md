# Utils

## Overview

The `Utils` module provides a set of utility classes and functions for managing parameters, mapping operators, and handling compound operations within the EPDE framework. It includes functionalities for loading default parameters, applying operators based on specified conditions, and structuring complex operators from simpler ones.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to facilitate the configuration and customization of the equation discovery process. It centralizes parameter management, enables conditional application of operators, and provides tools for building complex operations from simpler components. This allows users to fine-tune the evolutionary algorithms, optimization techniques, and other processes involved in discovering differential equations from data.
