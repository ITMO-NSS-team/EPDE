# Singleobjective

## Overview

The `singleobjective` module provides components for performing single-objective evolutionary optimization within the EPDE framework. It includes tools for defining stopping criteria, implementing mutation and crossover operators, and applying selection strategies. This module focuses on evolving equation structures to fit observed data by using specific genetic operators and selection mechanisms tailored for single-objective optimization.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `singleobjective` module is to facilitate the discovery of differential equations from data by using evolutionary algorithms that optimize a single objective function. This involves defining how candidate equations are mutated and crossed over, determining which individuals are selected for reproduction, and establishing criteria for when the evolutionary process should terminate. The module provides specific implementations for these steps, allowing users to effectively search for equation structures that best represent the underlying dynamics of a system.
