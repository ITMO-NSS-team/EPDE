# Multi-Objective Optimization Module

## Overview

This module focuses on multi-objective optimization techniques used within the EPDE framework. It provides tools for handling populations of candidate solutions, evaluating their performance across multiple objectives, and driving the evolutionary search process. Key functionalities include distributing solutions into sectors defined by weight vectors, selecting solutions based on Pareto dominance and penalty-based intersection, and updating populations by removing less desirable candidates. The module also incorporates mechanisms for constraint handling, ensuring that solutions adhere to specified constraints.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to implement the multi-objective optimization algorithms used to discover differential equations from data. It provides the necessary components for evolving a population of equation candidates, considering multiple objectives such as model accuracy and complexity. The module facilitates the search for Pareto-optimal solutions, representing the best trade-offs between competing objectives, and incorporates variation and selection operators to drive the evolutionary process.
