# Integration Module

## Overview

The Integration Module within the EPDE project focuses on numerically solving differential equations and handling boundary conditions. It provides tools for setting up and solving both ordinary and partial differential equations, including implicit equation systems. The module incorporates functionalities for spectral solvers, PINN (Physics-Informed Neural Networks) solvers, and traditional numerical integration methods. It also includes utilities for pre-generating boundary conditions and adapting various solvers to a unified interface.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Integration Module is to provide a set of tools and classes that facilitate the numerical solution of differential equations identified or modeled within the EPDE framework. This includes adapting different solver types (spectral, PINN, odeint), handling boundary conditions, and managing the setup of implicit equation systems for numerical computation. The module aims to bridge the gap between symbolic equation representation and numerical solution, enabling users to simulate and analyze the behavior of systems described by differential equations.
