# Preprocessing

## Overview

The `preprocessing` module provides a suite of tools for preparing data for differential equation discovery within the EPDE framework. It includes functionalities for smoothing, derivative calculation, domain pruning, and data interpolation/oversampling. The module offers a flexible pipeline for transforming raw data into a suitable format for subsequent equation learning algorithms.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `preprocessing` module is to facilitate the accurate and efficient estimation of derivatives from data, which is a crucial step in identifying underlying differential equations. It offers various methods for derivative calculation, including finite differences, Chebyshev polynomials, spectral methods, and neural networks. Additionally, it provides tools for data smoothing to reduce noise and domain pruning to focus on relevant regions of the data. The module aims to enhance the quality and reliability of the data used for equation discovery, ultimately improving the accuracy and interpretability of the identified models.
