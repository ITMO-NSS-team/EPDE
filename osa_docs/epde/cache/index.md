# Cache Module

## Overview

The Cache module provides functionalities for managing and storing intermediate data, such as tensors and grids, during the equation discovery process. It includes tools for uploading, transforming, and converting data between different formats (NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors). The module also incorporates neural networks for control purposes, encapsulating them within a dedicated container.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Cache module is to optimize the performance of the equation discovery process by caching and reusing intermediate computations. This involves storing precomputed tensors, managing data transformations, and providing a mechanism for integrating neural networks into the equation discovery workflow. The module facilitates the efficient evaluation of equation terms and factors, contributing to faster and more accurate identification of governing differential equations.
