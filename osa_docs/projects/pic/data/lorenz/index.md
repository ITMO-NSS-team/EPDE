# Lorenz

## Overview

The `lorenz` module focuses on discovering and analyzing the Lorenz system of equations using the EPDE (Evolutionary Partial Differential Equations) framework. It provides functionalities for loading pre-trained neural networks, adding noise to data, comparing symbolic equations, preparing sub-operators for fitness evaluation, and performing the EPDE search to identify the Lorenz system's governing equations.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to facilitate the identification of the Lorenz system's underlying equations from data. It leverages the EPDE framework to automate the process of discovering these equations, incorporating functionalities for data preprocessing, symbolic equation comparison, and customized search configurations. This allows users to gain insights into the dynamics of the Lorenz system and build corresponding models.
