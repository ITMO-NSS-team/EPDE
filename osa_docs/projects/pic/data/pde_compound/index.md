# PDE Compound Module

## Overview

The PDE Compound module is a core component of the EPDE project, designed to facilitate the comparison of PDE equations and manage the experimental process of discovering PDEs from data. It includes functionalities for handling data, creating fitness operators, and conducting experiments to identify the best PDE representations.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to streamline the process of discovering and validating differential equations from data. It provides tools for:

- Comparing PDE equations based on their fitness.
- Loading and preprocessing data for use in equation discovery.
- Creating and configuring fitness operators to evaluate equation performance.
- Conducting experiments to identify the most suitable PDE representations for a given dataset.
