# PDE Divide

## Overview

The PDE Divide module is designed to facilitate the analysis and experimentation of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It provides a structured environment for conducting experiments, handling data, comparing PDE equations, and creating fitness operators. The module includes functionalities for data loading, preprocessing, and comparison of different PDE structures to identify the best fit for observed data.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the PDE Divide module is to offer a toolkit for dividing and conquering the complexities of PDE analysis within the EPDE framework. It automates the process of setting up and executing experiments, comparing different PDE forms, and evaluating their fitness against data. This enables users to efficiently explore the solution space of potential differential equations and identify those that best represent the underlying dynamics of a system.
