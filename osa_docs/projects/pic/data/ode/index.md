# ODE Module

## Overview

The ODE module provides functionalities for discovering and analyzing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from data using the EPDE framework. It includes tools for loading pre-trained models, adding noise to data, comparing symbolic equations, and preparing sub-operators for fitness evaluation. The module also offers methods for testing the performance of the framework on simple ODEs and discovering ODEs from noisy data.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to facilitate the identification of governing ODEs from data, even when the data is corrupted by noise. It automates the process of setting up and executing EPDE searches, allowing users to explore the solution space of possible ODEs and discover equations that best fit the observed data. The module provides tools for data preprocessing, defining the search space, and evaluating the discovered equations.
