# Darcy

## Overview

The `Darcy` module focuses on discovering and analyzing differential equations specifically within the context of Darcy flow. It provides tools for loading Darcy flow data, adding noise, comparing symbolic equations, and preparing sub-operators for fitness calculations within the EPDE framework. The module also includes functionality for testing the performance of EPDE search on the Darcy equation.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to facilitate the identification of governing equations from Darcy flow data using the EPDE framework. It enables users to load and preprocess Darcy flow data, incorporate custom tokens representing physical properties, and perform equation searches to discover the underlying dynamics of fluid flow in porous media. The module also supports the evaluation of identified equations against known correct and incorrect forms.
