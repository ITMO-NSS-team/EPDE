# Lotka-Volterra System Equation Discovery (lv)

## Overview

This module focuses on discovering and modeling differential equations specifically for the Lotka-Volterra system using the EPDE framework. It provides functionalities for loading pre-trained models, adding noise to data, comparing symbolic equations, preparing sub-operators for fitness evaluation, and performing the equation discovery process.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to automate the identification of governing differential equations for the Lotka-Volterra system from data. It allows users to gain insights into the dynamics of predator-prey interactions and build predictive models for such systems. The module provides tools to compare equation stability and refine the search for the most accurate representation of the system's behavior.
