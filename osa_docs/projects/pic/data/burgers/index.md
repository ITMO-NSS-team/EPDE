# Burgers Module

## Overview

This module focuses on discovering the Burgers' equation from data using the EPDE (Equation Parameter Discovery and Estimation) framework. It provides functionalities for loading and processing Burgers' equation data, adding noise, setting up and executing the EPDE search, and comparing identified equations with known correct and incorrect equations. The module also includes utilities for preparing sub-operators for compound fitness operators and loading pretrained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to facilitate the identification of the Burgers' equation from noisy data. It automates the process of setting up and running an EPDE search, allowing users to discover the governing equation and verify its accuracy by comparing it with known equations. The module also provides tools for data preprocessing, noise addition, and model loading, making it easier to apply the EPDE framework to Burgers' equation discovery.
