# Wave Module

## Overview

The Wave module focuses on discovering and validating the wave equation from data using the EPDE framework. It includes functionalities for loading wave data, adding noise, comparing symbolic equations, preparing sub-operators for compound fitness evaluation, and performing the EPDE search. The module also provides utilities for loading pre-trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to facilitate the identification of the wave equation from data. It automates the process of setting up and executing an EPDE search, comparing discovered equations with known symbolic representations, and preparing fitness operators for optimization. This allows users to analyze wave phenomena and validate equation discovery methods within the EPDE framework.
