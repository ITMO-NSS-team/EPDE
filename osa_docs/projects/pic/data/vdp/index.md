# VDP Module

## Overview

The VDP (Van der Pol) module focuses on discovering and validating differential equations, specifically in the context of the Van der Pol oscillator. It provides functionalities for loading pre-trained models, adding noise to data, comparing symbolic equations, and preparing sub-operators for fitness evaluation. The module also includes methods for testing the EPDE search algorithm on the Van der Pol oscillator and discovering its governing equation from noisy data.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the VDP module is to facilitate the application of the EPDE framework to the Van der Pol oscillator problem. It offers tools for data manipulation, equation comparison, and fitness operator preparation, enabling users to effectively discover and validate the underlying differential equation of the Van der Pol oscillator from noisy data. This module serves as a specialized component within the EPDE project, focusing on a specific application of equation discovery.
