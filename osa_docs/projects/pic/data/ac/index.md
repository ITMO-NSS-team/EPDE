# AC Module

## Overview

The AC module focuses on discovering and validating differential equations, specifically in the context of the Allen-Cahn equation. It provides functionalities for loading data, adding noise, comparing symbolic equations, and preparing fitness operators for equation discovery. The module also includes a test scenario to evaluate performance on the Allen-Cahn equation.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the AC module is to facilitate the identification of the Allen-Cahn equation from data using the EPDE framework. It automates the process of loading data, adding noise, comparing symbolic equations, preparing fitness operators, and performing equation discovery. This allows users to gain insights into the underlying dynamics of the Allen-Cahn equation and build predictive models.
