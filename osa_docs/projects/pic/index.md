# Data Module

## Overview

The Data module is designed to facilitate the discovery and validation of differential equations from data, tailored to specific equations and systems. It provides functionalities for loading data, adding noise, comparing symbolic equations, and preparing fitness operators for equation discovery using the EPDE framework. The module includes specialized tools for handling data, setting up equation searches, and evaluating performance, making it easier to apply the EPDE framework to various equation discovery tasks.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Data module is to facilitate the identification of governing equations from data for specific systems like Allen-Cahn, Burgers', Darcy flow, KdV, Lorenz, Lotka-Volterra, Van der Pol oscillator, wave equation and general ODEs and PDEs. It automates the process of data preprocessing, noise injection, equation search setup, and performance evaluation, enabling users to identify equations using different EPDE-based approaches. The module also provides functionalities for comparing discovered equations with known correct and incorrect equations, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the equation discovery process.
