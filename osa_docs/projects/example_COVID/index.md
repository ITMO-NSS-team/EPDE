# Example COVID

## Overview

This module is designed to apply the EPDE framework to model and analyze data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It leverages evolutionary algorithms and multi-objective optimization techniques to discover and model differential equations that describe the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to automate the identification of governing differential equations from COVID-19 related data. This enables users to gain insights into the underlying dynamics of the pandemic and build predictive models for its spread.
