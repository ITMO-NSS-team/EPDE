# Lorenz

## Overview

This module focuses on simulating and analyzing the Lorenz system and similar dynamical systems, such as the Lotka-Volterra model. It provides tools for solving differential equations using numerical methods, visualizing solutions in both 2D and 3D plots, and discovering governing equations from simulation data.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to provide functionalities for simulating, visualizing, and discovering equations related to dynamical systems. It includes tools for:

- Simulating the dynamics of systems like the Lorenz system and Lotka-Volterra model using the Runge-Kutta method.
- Visualizing the solutions of these systems through 2D and 3D plots.
- Discovering governing equations from simulation data and writing Pareto front solutions to files.
