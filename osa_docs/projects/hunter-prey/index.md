# Hunter-Prey

## Overview

The Hunter-Prey module focuses on simulating and analyzing predator-prey dynamics using mathematical modeling and equation discovery techniques. It employs the Runge-Kutta method to simulate the Lotka-Volterra model, a classic representation of biological systems with interacting predator and prey species. Additionally, it incorporates functionality for identifying governing equations from simulation data, utilizing Pareto front analysis to find optimal solutions.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to provide tools for simulating and understanding the dynamics of predator-prey interactions. It allows users to model population changes over time using the Lotka-Volterra equations and the Runge-Kutta method. Furthermore, it facilitates the discovery of potential underlying equations by writing Pareto front solutions to files for further analysis. This enables the identification of equations that best describe the observed dynamics of the simulated system.
