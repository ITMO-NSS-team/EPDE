# Multi Objective Algebraic Expression

## Overview

The `multi_objective_algebraic_expression` module is designed to handle data retrieval within the EPDE framework. It provides a function to access specific data points from a loaded dataset.

## Purpose

The module's primary purpose is to facilitate data access by index, ensuring that the correct data is available for the evolutionary algorithms and multi-objective optimization processes used in discovering and modeling differential equations. It serves as a utility for retrieving data points required for fitting equation structures to observed data.
