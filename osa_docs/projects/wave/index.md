# Wave Module

## Overview

The Wave module focuses on translating and evaluating differential equations within the EPDE framework. It provides functionality to load data, set up coordinate grids, define terms for a differential equation, and perform a search for suitable equation structures. The module leverages evolutionary algorithms and multi-objective optimization techniques to identify equations that best fit the provided data.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Wave module is to facilitate the discovery of governing differential equations from data by translating and evaluating them. It automates the process of setting up and searching for equation structures, allowing users to gain insights into the underlying dynamics of complex systems. The module evaluates the generated equations by mapping them to a function, such as `np.mean`, to assess their performance.
