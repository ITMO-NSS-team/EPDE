# ODE Module

## Overview

The ODE module within the EPDE project focuses on discovering and modeling ordinary differential equations from data. It provides tools for data preparation, equation discovery using evolutionary algorithms, and integration with numerical solvers to validate discovered equations. The module includes functionalities for solving second-order ODEs using the Runge-Kutta method, performing EPDE searches with custom tokens (e.g., trigonometric functions or inverse coordinate values), and extracting equations with specified complexity.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the ODE module is to facilitate the identification of governing ordinary differential equations from data. This involves preparing data representing the solution of an ODE, setting up an EPDE search object, configuring its parameters, and then performing the search. It allows users to explore the solution space of possible equations and identify those that best fit the observed data, even incorporating custom functions and tokens to expand the search capabilities.
