# Burgers Equation Module

## Overview

This module focuses on providing utilities for formatting strings, specifically tailored for representing and manipulating equations related to Burgers' equation within the EPDE framework. It includes functionalities for replacing patterns and rounding floating-point numbers within a string representation of an equation.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to ensure consistent and readable output of Burgers' equation representations during the equation discovery and modeling process. By providing a dedicated formatting function, the module aims to improve the interpretability of the discovered equations and facilitate their integration with other components of the EPDE project.
