# wSINDy

## Overview

The `wSINDy` module focuses on applying and comparing two equation discovery methods, SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics) and EPDE (Equation Parameter Discovery and Estimation), to various partial differential equations (PDEs). It includes functionalities for data preparation, derivative calculation, library construction, sparse regression, and equation formatting. The module provides tools to translate SINDy equations into human-readable formats and to write Pareto front solutions to files for multi-objective optimization results.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `wSINDy` module is to facilitate the identification of governing equations from data generated by known PDEs, such as the Burgers' equation, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, Lotka-Volterra equations, and the wave equation. It allows users to explore the effectiveness of SINDy and EPDE in discovering these equations, compare their performance, and analyze the resulting models. The module also aims to provide utilities for formatting and presenting the discovered equations in a clear and interpretable manner.
