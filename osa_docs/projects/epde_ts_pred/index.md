# EPDE Time Series Prediction Module

## Overview

The EPDE Time Series Prediction module focuses on discovering and fitting differential equations to time series data. It includes functionality for determining parameter value differences, which are crucial for identifying unique equation structures and terms. This module is designed to work within the broader EPDE framework, leveraging evolutionary algorithms to find the best-fitting equations.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to facilitate the automated discovery of differential equations that accurately model time series data. It allows users to define acceptable parameter variations, ensuring that the identified equations are both accurate and structurally unique. This module contributes to the overall goal of EPDE by enabling the identification of governing equations from time-dependent data.
