# Projects Module

## Overview

The Projects module serves as a collection of case studies and benchmarks for the EPDE (Equation Parameter Discovery and Estimation) framework. It encompasses a variety of submodules, each focusing on applying EPDE to specific equations, systems, or datasets. These submodules provide tools for data handling, equation search configuration, result evaluation, and visualization. The module facilitates the exploration of EPDE's capabilities in discovering governing equations across diverse scientific domains.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Projects module is to demonstrate and evaluate the EPDE framework's effectiveness in identifying governing equations from data across a range of applications. It provides concrete examples of how EPDE can be used to rediscover known equations, model complex systems, and gain insights into underlying dynamics. By showcasing the application of EPDE to specific problems, the module aims to guide users in applying the framework to their own research and modeling tasks.
